# API-code-snippets

This is a set of snippets for different languages with the bare minimum code necessary to 
make a http POST with basic auth to the 46elks API.

The intention is thats these can be used as a base for building the code needed to 
implement the API in your language/system. This way fault-handling, credential-handling etc. 
can be done in the way your project is working today.
